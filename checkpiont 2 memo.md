# Checkpiont 2 

## Implementation

* Classes should be implemented in a separate file `data_structures.py` Need constructor and accessor, no mutator needed at this point.
* `class Student`
  * attribute: `prefs`
  * (poss. extension): ranking of preference for each class, `class_year`,`major`
* `class Classroom`
  * attribute: `capacity`
* `class Course`
  * attributes: `name` (int for basic version),`teacher`, `specs` - a list of prospective students, initialize to `[]`
  * possible extension: `department`, `is_core`
* functions`schedule_class`, `choose_student`, `print_output`

## Packages to use
* `import pandas as pd`
* `from queue import` whatever function/methods you need
* `from collections import defaultdict`

// Ignore this

Output format

* File 1:
  * Rows headers: Classrooms
  * Columns: time slots
* File 2:
  * Row headers: Classes

## Tasks:
* Yutong - parse input
* Mark - class implementation
* Jiaping - output schedule


*Deadline*: try to finish by _next Monday_ (including as much of the haverford extension as we can do)

## Extended Version: 

### Tentative Constraints

1. Must schedule core classes for each department
2. Assign priority to students according to class year
3. Assign popularity to time slots. Schedule popular class at more popular times.
4. Can have multiple potential teachers for the same course
5. Teachers have personal conflicts
6. Classes have prerequisites - these can be scheduled at the same time.
7. Quarter classes vs. semester classes
8. Lectures vs. Labs (1 class can have multiple lab sections, but lab runs only once a week)

### Available Info

1. Enrollment data from the past
2. number of major & minor students
3. class level (higher level classes in smaller classrooms)
4. department info (allow conflicts across categories SO, HU, NS)
